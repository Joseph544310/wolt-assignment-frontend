# About

This is my solution to the [Wolt Frontend Assignment](https://github.com/woltapp/summer2021-internship)
I used React with TypeScript and made use of other libraries like react-bootstrap, react-blurhash and react-icons.

## How to run

You can quickly check the result by visiting the [deployed version](https://wolt-frontend-assignment.web.app/)

Or to run it locally clone the repo and run:

1-npm install
2-npm start
